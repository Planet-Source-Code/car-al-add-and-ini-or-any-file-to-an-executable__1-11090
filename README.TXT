Here's yet another sample of combining files together. Anyway... you can run the File_in_File.exe or the project. It is set up to combine the File_in_File.exe and the Test.txt files into one called Combine.exe. If you then extract, it will create a file called Extract.txt, which should be identical to the Test.txt file. Got it?

Why do this? In this simplest form the best thing I can think to do with it would be to keep an .INI file hidden in your .EXE files...

However it could be modified to handle more than 2 files, compress, ect... which makes for a nice tool. Well, thats it.
